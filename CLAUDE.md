# Project guidance

Project knowledge lives under `.project-docs/`.

Before making a non-trivial project-specific claim:

1. read `.project-docs/manifest.yaml`;
2. follow `.project-docs/navigation.md`;
3. search the routed locations and read the canonical record plus material
   related links;
4. check status, freshness, and sources.

Use `project.md` for scope, `bugs/` for review findings, and
`open-questions.md` for unresolved product and operational questions.
Review findings apply to the cited commit; verify them against current code
before making changes. Scripts under `review-checks/` reproduce the reviewed
defects; they are not a passing regression suite for a future fixed version.

Do not treat observations, stale claims, conflicts, recommendations, or
unknowns as confirmed facts. Never store, quote, partially reproduce,
transform, or echo secret values.

Change project guidance only through the `project-documentation` workflow at
the canonical editable source, `.project-docs/agent-context.md`. Do not edit
`AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` directly; both generated targets are byte-identical
to the canonical source.

After every documentation mutation, run
`python3 <skill-directory>/scripts/validate_project_documentation.py
--project-root <project-root> --tracked-documentation`. Add `--include` for a
new untracked documentation file. If canonical guidance changed, also run the
guidance synchronization script with `--diff`, `--write`, and `--check`.
Documentation work is incomplete until validation and synchronization pass.
